# About Me
My name is Brandi Whitmore and I am a Freshman at the University of Missouri. For a little background I have been through my share of unfortunate events throughout my life however I **refuse** to let them get the best of me. I have learned to use the different things that life hands to me and learn from them to be more compassionate and understand for others. You **never** know what a person is going through so I attempt to be as understanding as I can.
